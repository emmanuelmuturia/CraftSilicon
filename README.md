## 1) Background

- This project is an implementation of the Take Home Assignment offered by Craft Silicon...
- It utilises [The OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) which has the following endpoints:

### a) /api/account/v2/auth/token

- This endpoint retrieves an Authentication Token to be used for logging in...

### b) /api/account/v2/token/refresh

- This endpoint retrieves a new Authentication Token to replace the original one generated by the previous endpoint...

### c) /api/v1/profile/public/error/codes

- This endpoint fetches a list of Error Codes to be used within the app...

## 2) Architecture

- Craft Silicon is a multi-module Android app implemented using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architectural Pattern...
- It is divided into the following modules:

### a) :app

- This is the main module that houses the Main Activity, Application Class, and NavHost...
- MainActivity acts as the entry-point of the app following the Dependency Injection implementation while Craft SiliconApplication initialises the app, while the NavHost defines the app's Navigation Hierarchy...

### b) :authentication

- This module contains the Login Screen and its ViewModel...
- It provides the Login functionality by making an API call using the POST method to retrieve an Authentication Token from the REST API server...

### c) :commons

- It contains all of the shared resources within the app such as UI Components, and Theme...

### d) :home

- This module contains the HomeScreen and its ViewModel...
- It is used to display static data that matches a real-world delivery app's "Recent Deliveries" section...

## 5) Trivia

- Craft Silicon has used a hybrid modularisation technique where each of the modules listed above has implemented sub-modules that match the Presentation, Domain, and Data Layers in Android...

## 6) Credits

- Craft Silicon has been built using the following Tools, Technologies, and Libraries:

a] Jetpack Compose

- The app has utilised Google's modern UI toolkit ([Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)) for its User Interface that prioritises the Kotlin-first approach of Android App Development (AAD)...

b] Koin

- For Dependency Injection using Kotlin, [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) has been used in conjunction with:

c] Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)

- For faster builds regarding Annotations, [KSP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html) has been implemented as a plugin...

d] Retrofit2

- As a core library, [Retrofit2](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) has been utilised for performing remote calls to the REST API through a level of abstraction...

e] OkHTTP3

- In addition to Retrofit2, [OkHTTP3](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) has also been implemented to aid in configuring the remote calls by providing an Interceptor and specifying the expected data type as JSON...

f] Kotlin Serialization

- During the remote calls, the returned data has been serialized and deserialized using the [Kotlin Serialization Plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html)...

g] Splash Screen

- The app has implemented its Splash Screen using Google's [Splash Screen API](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen) which uses its custom theme alongside the app's theme...

h] LeakCanary

- To detect and fix memory leaks, [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/) has been implemented...

i] MockK, Kotlin Coroutines Test, and MockWebServer

- During testing [MockK](https://mockk.io/) has been used to mimic the dependencies to be tested resulting in a close-to-real test case scenario...
- [MockWebServer](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver) has been used to test the Network Requests made by the app...
- The Unit Tests used the [Kotlin Coroutines Test](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-test/) library to provide the Coroutine Scopes for the suspending functions that were being tested...
